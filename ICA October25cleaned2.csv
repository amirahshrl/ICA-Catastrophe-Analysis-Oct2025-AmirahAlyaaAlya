CAT018,Bushfire,24/12/2001,7/1/2002,FY01,,,"The Black Christmas bushfires were bushfires that burnt for almost three weeks from 24 December 2001 to 7 January 2002 across New South Wales, Australia. It was the longest continuous bushfire emergency in NSW history.  Low rainfall across winter & spring 2001 combined with a hot, dry December created ideal conditions for bushfires. On the day of Christmas Eve, firefighters from the Grose Vale Rural Fire Service (RFS) brigade attended a blaze in rugged terrain at the end of Cabbage Tree Rd, Grose Vale, believed to have been caused by a poorly extinguished campfire in the Grose Valley.  On Christmas Day, strong westerly winds fuelled more than 100 bushfires across the state, creating a plume of smoke that extended across Sydney. This plume of smoke would not clear for some days as the bushfires continued to burn, creating some of the worst pollution that Sydney has ever experienced, with a regional pollution index reading of: 200 in North-West Sydney; 120 in Central-East and South-West Sydney. The fires mainly burnt in Lane Cove National Park, the Royal National Park & Blue Mountains National Park. Overall approximately 3,000 square kilometres (740,000 acres) were burnt. 121 homes were destroyed across the state and 36 damaged, mostly in the lower Blue Mountains and west of the Royal National Park around Helensburgh. Arsonists were believed to be responsible for starting many of the fires, leading to harsher penalties for those who start bushfires.",Bushfire,2001,,69000000.00,269400000.00,,,,,,,,,,

The cyclone passed close to the south-west corner of Western Australia on 4 April 1978, killing five people and causing widespread but mostly minor damage to the south-west. Storm surges and large waves caused coastal inundation and erosion from Perth to Busselton, while very strong winds caused fires that burned hectares of forest and farming land.

Major impact in Taree where the Manning River reached a peak of 5.6m and areas around Port Macquarie. The Western Sydney suburbs around Penrith and along the Nepean river were submerged after the river burst its banks. 150mm of rain to the Warragamba Dam catchment caused it to spill adding to the already swollen Nepean River.

The banana industry in the region was almost wiped out, losing about 200,000 tonnes of fruit, worth about $300 million, representing approximately 80 percent of Australia's banana crop. The storm also destroyed at least $15 million worth of avocados. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2006 damage at $540 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $609 million.",Cyclone,2006,,540000000.00,914800000.00,,,,,,,,,,

Rainfall peaked in Tully where approximately 1,000 mm (39 in) of rain fell, with 632 mm (24.9 in) falling over a 48 hour span. The township of Scherger received a record-breaking 370 mm (15 in) in just 24 hours. These rains caused widespread flooding in the state that shut down many roads and isolated communities. The town of Ingham was completely cut off due to high waters. Residents in the town were advised to stock up on emergency supplies as the Herbert River rose rapidly after 200 mm (7.9 in) of rain fell in the town in just three hours. In Cairns, winds up to 90 km/h (56 mph) left many homes without power and waves up to 4 m (13 ft) prompted the cancellation of most coastal activities. Additionally, a brief tornado or waterspout with winds of 140 km/h (87 mph) touched down near Hay Point.

The storm hit at around 4pm 21 January 1991 and moved out to sea at approximately 5.15pm. Estimated wind strengths (based on damage) of 118 km per hour to 230 km per hour brought down many trees (at least 50,000 significant trees were felled or suffered long-term damage). Falling trees damaged over 10,000 houses, with over 100 completely unroofed and 20 totally destroyed. At least 1000 other buildings incurred damage and many businesses suffered extensive damage. About 140 km of power lines and three steel towers were brought down. (Clean up and restoration of essential services took weeks). Worst hit were the northern suburbs of Turramurra, Lindfield and Wahroonga, while in the west, Seven Hills, Blacktown, Parramatta, Castle Hill, Wollondilly and Dural reported extensive storm damage.",Storm,1991,,215400000.00,1708400000.00,,,,,,,,,,

Severe storms moved through Perth between 3.30 pm and 6 pm with large hail at record levels, heavy rain and severe winds that resulted in considerable damage.  The storm was responsible for record numbers of power outages more than 150,000 properties were without power at the peak, 300 hazard incidents and affected flight, train and bus services. The number of requests for assistance from FESA and SES totalled more than 3000, the most significant number since the May 1994 wind storms. Approximately 15 schools in the northern suburbs were closed the following day due to damage, while many hospitals were also damaged.  Large hail occurred in a strip from the northern coastal suburbs to south Perth. For many suburbs, particularly from Osborne Park to Crawley, hail from 4-6 cm was large enough to badly damage cars, break car windscreens and windows of houses.

CAT114,Cylone Yasi,26/1/2011,6/2/2011,FY10,FNQ,,"Cyclone Yasi developed as a tropical low north-west of Fiji on 29 January 2011. On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February. In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends. Flights out of the region were fully booked. The hospital's 300 patients were evacuated to Brisbane and other regional hospitals by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other means of transportation.  This was an unprecedented evacuation effort. The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone’s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars found metres away from where they were left and boats piled on top of each other in some regions. Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville. The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million loss to agricultural production in Queensland, particularly the banana and sugarcane sector. The Federal Government processed more than $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000. There was one recorded death.",Cyclone,2011,,1412239000.00,2100700000.00,,,,,,,,,,

Coinciding Tropical Cyclone Bella also brought about extensive rain towards the end of March. The heavy rainfall caused river levels to rise and flood across Queensland including the Herbert, Tully, Nicholson, Gregory, Georgina, Burke, Hamilton, Diamantina, Thomson and Cloncurry.  The Bruce Highway, connecting Cairns and Townsville, was inundated with water and was subsequently cut in six places.

CAT852,Brisbane Hail Storm,18/1/1985,18/1/1985,FY84,,,"The afternoon of Friday the 18th of January, 1985 is remembered by many Brisbane residents as the worst storm they had ever experienced. At the time, it was the second most damaging natural disaster (to the 1974 floods) in the history of Queensland.  In terms of destructive thunderstorms in SE Qld this storm came first, and daylight second. It was a typical Brisbane Summer day, with hot and sultry NW/NE winds. Brisbane residents were bearing up to the heat in anticipation of a cooling thunderstorm ahead of a fresh SE wind change. And that's exactly what happened, but nobody thought the storm would be so severe. A coastal front had slowed and was in the Coolangatta area, and a trough was located over the inland, but ominously, a cold pool of air lay in the upper levels to the SW of Brisbane. During the early afternoon, storms developed as they frequently do in Summer on the Border Ranges, to the South and SSW of Brisbane.  From 2:30pm one particular storm became organised, and by 3:20pm a severe thunderstorm was reported at Mt Alford, SSW of Boonah.  That was the start of Brisbane's most damaging ever thunderstorm. By 4pm, the thunderstorm had assumed massive proportions with cloudtops at 18km and there was a large area of maximum reflectivity - indicative of hail. It was located just east of Harrisville south of Ipswich at this time, and destructive winds and large hail were being reported.  At 4:20pm, with the Goodna area in the far SW Brisbane suburbs being affected, cloudtops suddenly fell to around 16km, but nevertheless, the storm was as severe as ever.  The storm started intensifying again, so that at 4:50pm the cloudtops were nearing 17km as it approached Brisbane's CBD from the SSW. With workers starting to drive home with a weekend in front of them, it hit. Suburbs including Oxley, Kenmore, Toowong, Chermside, Hendra, Nundah and Sandgate were hit particularly hard.  At the Regional Office of the Brisbane Bureau of Meteorology in the CBD a record wind gust of 145km/h (78kn) was recorded, and then one of the most extreme officially recorded wind gusts in the history of Australian storms struck: 185km/h (100kn) at the Brisbane Airport.  That's close to a 193km/h recorded gust at Tennant Creek in the 1960's.  The winds blew hailstones of up to 7cm in diameter almost horizontal resulting in infinite smashed windows.  Many residents resorted to hiding under tables and mattresses as the giant hailstones smashed through the windows and ferocious winds blew off roofs. At Toombul, damage was severe.  A man whose apartment block had been completely unroofed said: ""The sound was amazing. There were bits of corrugated iron and guttering flying though the air and crashing up against the two buildings"". At the Brisbane Airport, where the extreme wind gust was recorded, 12 pre-fabricated site office sheds were blown and rolled at least a distance of 100m then damaged severely. It was estimated that 20% of the vehicles in the city were hail damaged, over 20 000 buildings damaged and 80 000 premises were blacked out.  The Wool Store furniture centre in Newfarm had 2500 broken windows on the windward side of the building, their damage bill being $5 million.  Amazingly, the store had survived every storm undamaged since 1927. The rainfall intensities that came with the storm were particularly high. Between 60 and 70mm were reported from SW suburbs, the inner City and some N and NE suburbs.  At the Eagle Farm Airport, a 15 min intensity of 57mm was recorded - that's a rate of 228mm/hour. At Clayfield, a family were caught in their home when the local creek rapidly rose. They were luckily able to get out when the water was up to their shoulders.",Hail,1985,,180000000.00,3745900000.00,,,,,,,,,,

Fires raged from near Hamilton and Bothwell to the D'Entrecasteaux Channel as well as Snug. There was extensive damage to agricultural property along the Channel, the Derwent Valley and the Huon Valley. Fires also destroyed forest, public infrastructure and properties around Mount Wellington and many small towns along the Derwent estuary and east of Hobart. The worst of the fires was the Hobart Fire, which encroached upon the city of Hobart. In total, the fires claimed 62 lives in a single day. Property loss was also extensive with 1293 homes and over 1700 other buildings destroyed. The fires destroyed 80 bridges, 4800 sections of power lines, 1500 motor vehicles and over 100 other structures. It was estimated that at least 62,000 farm animals were killed.

CAT894,Newcastle CDB Earthquake,28/12/1989,28/12/1989,FY89,,,"On 28 December 1989 at 10.27 am, an earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale hit Newcastle. The earthquake's epicentre was approximately 15 km from Newcastle's central business district. The earthquake caused widespread damage to infrastructure including roads, bridges and power lines. It damaged 50,000 buildings, including 40,000 homes. As a result 13 individuals lost their lives and 160 were injuried. In February 1990, Cyclone Nancy dumped a large amount of rain on Newcastle, which increased the rate of movement in some structures and prompted the discovery of leaks in buildings that had previously been considered structurally sound after the earthquake.",Earthquake,1989,,862000000.00,6542200000.00,,,,,,,,,,
CAT746,Cyclone TRACEY,21/12/1974,25/12/1974,FY74,,,"Tropical Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin in the early hours of 25 December 1974, and was rated a Category 4 cyclone. Before the instruments failed, the wind gauges registered speeds of 217 km per hour. The cyclone caused massive building and infrastructure damage to all power, water, sanitation and communications as well as huge commercial and industrial losses. More than 80 per cent of all buildings were destroyed or seriously damaged. The cyclone resulted in the death of 71 people, which included 22 who were lost at sea. Cyclone Tracy caused the largest ever evacuation and reconstruction operations in peacetime Australia. A total of 35,362 people (of the approx 47,000 population) were evacuated; 25,628 by air (15,950 in civilian aircraft and 9678 in military aircraft) and the remaining 9734 by road, to southern cities for many months.  By 1978, it was estimated that Darwin had regained the population level it had in December 1974.",Cyclone,1974,,200000000.00,7397400000.00,,,,,,,,,,
